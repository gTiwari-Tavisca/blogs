                                    Rental arbitrage gives you a way to make money with Airbnb — without owning any property.

                                    Traditionally, building a real estate side hustle takes big bucks for down payments, closing costs, and renovation projects.
                                    
                                    But enterprising short-term rental “moguls” are questioning if owning the property is even necessary. These rental arbitrage entrepreneurs sign long-term leases, and then turn around and sub-let the property on a short-term basis — profiting on the spread.
